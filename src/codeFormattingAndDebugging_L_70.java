		//Important point to be followed by Industry Standard-->
		/*Alwayas use Camel casing while writing the class name  and variable name
		 * Always First Letter of class name will be in capital(Same logic is applied

		 * Eg: Public class Bubblesort(){
		 * }
		 * Eg: Tableexercise
		 * While declaring the variable name -->
		 * Always letter start with small letter
		 * Eg: String name = 'Shyam'
		 * String mousePad;
		 * 
		 *  
		 *  When you have mutltiple letter in word then we have follow this way-->
		 *  int rowCount;
		 *  int colCount;
		 *  int extraValues
		 *  int totalSumValues;
