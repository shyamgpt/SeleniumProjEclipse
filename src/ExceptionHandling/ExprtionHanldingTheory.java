/*In a program, if there is a chance of raising an exception 
 * then the compiler always warns us about it and compulsorily 
 * we should handle that checked exception, Otherwise, 
 * we will get compile time error saying unreported exception 
 * XXX must be caught or declared to be thrown. 
 * To prevent this compile time error we can handle the exception 
 * in two ways: 

By using try catch
By using the throws keyword
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * There are several ways to handle exceptions, including:
Try and catch blocks  ->
Wrap the code you want to run in a try block, 
then follow it with a catch block to catch any exceptions.


Throws clause -->
List the exceptions you want to handle in the throws clause of the 
method, and let the method's caller handle them.


Finally block -->
Use the finally block along with the try and catch blocks. This block will always run, regardless of whether an exception occurs or if it's handled
